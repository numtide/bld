# nix-stdlib

A batteries-included standard library for Nix.

The Nix `builtins` and accompanied functions in `<nixpkgs/lib>` have grown
organically, without too much consideration for their taxonomy or re-use
capabilities.

This is an effort to re-think the basic tools made available to the user.

Compatible with nix 1.12+ only.
